# Introduction: The Global Context for Coal Power Phase-Out

The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with an increasing focus on phasing out coal power to mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for coal may peak within this decade, driven by declining usage in developed economies and a slower economic 
outlook for China [1]. This shift underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to reduce coal consumption while maintaining grid stability.

The World Bank's "Scaling Up to Phase Down" approach proposes innovative solutions for financing energy transitions in developing countries, which face unique challenges such as high 
upfront capital costs for renewable projects and limited access to clean energy alternatives [2]. These strategies include repurposing plants for flexibility, retrofitting with carbon 
capture technology, and retiring less efficient plants early.

Financing emerges as a critical factor in accelerating the global energy transition away from coal. Significant investment in clean energy technologies is required, especially in 
emerging and developing economies, to achieve a net-zero emissions future. The IEA emphasizes the importance of enhancing international support and scaling up private capital for clean 
power, efficiency, and electrification [3].

Recent studies highlight the complex socio-economic challenges associated with coal power phase-out. Lack of proactive planning and support for affected communities can lead to 
significant hardships, including job losses, environmental degradation, and social deprivation [4][5]. Successful transitions require not only financial investment but also 
comprehensive planning that includes economic diversification, job creation, and community benefits to ensure a just and equitable shift away from coal.

In conclusion, the global context for coal power phase-out highlights the pivotal role of financing in supporting the transition to lower-carbon sources. It calls for robust policy 
frameworks, international cooperation, and innovative financing mechanisms to overcome barriers and facilitate a just and equitable energy transition.

# Current Initiatives for Coal Power Phase-Out

As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, various initiatives have been launched globally to phase out coal power. These efforts are crucial in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards cleaner energy sources. Notable examples include Germany's Coal Phase-Out Act and the Philippines' moratorium on new coal projects, 
which demonstrate a commitment to ending reliance on coal for energy production [1][2].

Germany's approach involves compensating power companies for closing coal power plants early, either through agreed closure dates or competitive auctions. This strategy aims to reduce 
coal generation capacity systematically by 2038. Similarly, the Philippines has implemented a moratorium on new coal since 2020, focusing on leveraging its clean energy potential for 
economic development and affordable electricity [2].

Financing solutions play a pivotal role in accelerating the phase-out of coal power, especially in the Asia Pacific region. Initiatives like the GFANZ report emphasize the use of 
public and private capital to acquire coal assets for early retirement, incentivize existing plant owners to shorten operating lives, and provide alternative revenue streams from 
renewable energy projects [3].

The new research from Greenpeace and ISF highlights the importance of a just transition for coal-dependent communities, showcasing international case studies from Germany, Poland, 
South Africa, and Indonesia. These studies emphasize the need for local bottom-up initiatives, active labor market policies tailored to coal communities, and the diversification of 
local economies to mitigate the impacts of the transition. Moreover, they underline the critical role of environmental standards and the empowerment of vulnerable groups in ensuring a 
just and equitable transition away from coal power [5].

However, challenges remain, including the need for substantial investment, policy support, and international cooperation to ensure a just and equitable transition. Future research 
should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of these initiatives, identifying best practices, and exploring innovative financing models to support the global move away from coal 
power.

More research could be done on the global inventory of coal power plants scheduled for phase-out. Future works to enhance could involve financial analysis of the costs and benefits 
associated with coal power plant closures. More analysis is needed on the impact assessment of coal power phase-out on electricity prices and energy security. Case studies on 
successful transitions from coal to renewable energy sources would provide valuable insights. Detailed analysis of the socio-economic impacts of coal phase-out in coal-dependent 
communities is also essential for understanding the broader implications of these initiatives.

# Challenges in Coal Power Phase-Out Financing

The global initiative to phase out coal power is fraught with significant financial and regulatory challenges, pivotal in determining the pace and success of these efforts. The 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted several primary hurdles, including the high cost associated with decommissioning and retiring coal-fired power plants, especially in 
emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) [1]. These costs encompass not only the physical dismantling of facilities but also social adjustments and compensations for displaced 
workers.

Moreover, the persistence of fossil fuel subsidies exacerbates the difficulty of transitioning away from coal. In 2022, total fossil fuel subsidies surged to a record high, 
particularly in EMDEs, creating a financial incentive to continue coal usage [1]. Another challenge is the projected shortfall in the supply of critical metals and minerals essential 
for renewable energy technologies, which could increase their costs and slow down the energy transition [2].

The age of coal power plants varies significantly across regions, with many EMDEs hosting relatively young plants. This disparity makes it financially and politically challenging to 
justify their early closure [3]. Additionally, many financial institutions have yet to align their policies and commitments with net-zero climate targets, further hindering the 
transition [4].

Recent research highlights the effectiveness of direct regulation, financial measures, and market-based interventions in facilitating the coal power phase-out. Countries like China 
have successfully implemented direct regulations to retire old units and build more efficient coal plants. Financial incentives, such as low-cost government debt and loan guarantees, 
have proven effective in encouraging plant owners to transition to cleaner energy sources. Market-based measures, including carbon pricing schemes, reduce the economic incentives for 
continued operation of coal plants, promoting a shift towards renewable energy [5][6].

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including withdrawing fossil fuel subsidies, implementing emission pricing policies, and enhancing international 
cooperation to mobilize private capital for clean energy projects. The IMF recommends building larger fiscal buffers and adjusting upstream fiscal regimes as part of the strategy to 
facilitate a smoother transition away from coal power [1][4].

## Future Works

- More research could be done on the **detailed cost breakdown of decommissioning coal power plants in various regions** to better understand the financial barriers to coal phase-out.
- **Analysis of the impact of fossil fuel subsidies on coal power phase-out initiatives** could provide insights into how policy reforms can accelerate the transition.
- Future works to enhance could involve **projection of demand and supply for critical metals and minerals required for renewable energy technologies up to 2050**, addressing potential 
bottlenecks in the energy transition.
- **Evaluation of the effectiveness of current financial institutions' policies in supporting the coal power phase-out** could identify gaps and opportunities for aligning financial 
flows with climate goals.
- **Comparative analysis of the effectiveness of direct regulation, financial measures, and market-based interventions across different countries** would offer valuable lessons on best 
practices and strategies for accelerating coal power phase-out.

# Opportunities for NGOs and Impact Funds

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and impact funds play a pivotal role in accelerating the transition away from coal power, offering unique opportunities to influence policy, 
mobilize resources, and support affected communities. Their involvement ranges from advocacy and lobbying for stronger environmental policies to direct financial investments in clean 
energy projects.

One significant opportunity for NGOs lies in advocacy and public awareness campaigns. By raising awareness about the environmental and health impacts of coal power, NGOs can pressure 
governments and corporations to commit to more ambitious coal phase-out timelines. For instance, several European NGOs have successfully urged governments to set definitive coal, oil, 
and gas phase-out dates, demonstrating the power of coordinated advocacy efforts [4].

Impact funds, on the other hand, offer a direct route to facilitating the coal-to-clean energy transition through innovative financing models. The Rockefeller Foundation's exploration 
of the world's first Coal to Clean Credit Program exemplifies how impact investing can create incentives for transitioning to renewable energy sources in emerging economies [3]. This 
program aims to leverage carbon credits to finance the retirement of coal plants and the development of clean energy infrastructure, showcasing a novel approach to blending 
philanthropic goals with investment strategies.

Furthermore, the Just Transition Toolkit provides case studies on supporting economic diversification in regions heavily dependent on coal [1]. These initiatives highlight the 
importance of ensuring that the transition away from coal does not leave communities behind but instead creates new opportunities for sustainable development.

Recent research underscores the complexity of coal retirement and the need for tailored approaches in different national contexts. The ADBI Working Paper 1412 discusses various 
business models for at-scale retirement of coal-fired power plants, emphasizing the importance of policy-based closures, buyouts, and hybrid models [6]. Additionally, concerns about 
the effectiveness of carbon credit methodologies and the risk of emission leakage in energy systems highlight the need for stringent criteria and careful consideration of renewable 
replacements for retired coal capacity [7].

In conclusion, NGOs and impact funds are indispensable allies in the global effort to phase out coal power. Through advocacy, innovative financing, and support for just transitions, 
they can help overcome barriers to clean energy adoption and ensure that the move away from coal benefits both the planet and its inhabitants.

Indonesia's journey towards coal power phase-out is marked by ambitious government policies, international collaborations, and significant financial mechanisms aimed at reducing its 
dependency on coal while ensuring energy security and economic stability. The country's initiatives offer valuable insights into the complexities of transitioning from coal to 
renewable energy sources in developing economies.

A landmark agreement facilitated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to retire the 660-megawatt Cirebon-1 coal-fired power plant nearly 7 years ahead of schedule [1]. This 
initiative represents a critical step forward in Indonesia's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transition towards cleaner energy sources. The collaboration between ADB, PT 
PLN, PT Cirebon Electric Power, and the Indonesia Investment Authority underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in achieving ambitious environmental goals.

Furthermore, Indonesia has taken proactive steps by canceling planned coal-fired power plants totaling 13.3 GW and halting new developments of coal-fired power plants (CFPP). These 
actions reflect a strong commitment to shifting the country's energy mix towards more sustainable sources. However, challenges remain, including the continued construction of new coal 
plants, highlighting the tension between short-term energy needs and long-term sustainability goals [2][5].

International support plays a crucial role in Indonesia's coal phase-out strategy. The European Union and several G20 countries have pledged $20 billion to assist Indonesia in this 
transition [4]. This substantial financial backing aims to facilitate the adoption of cleaner energy alternatives and support the country's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), 
which seeks to balance environmental objectives with socio-economic considerations.

Despite these positive developments, Indonesia faces hurdles in fully realizing its coal phase-out ambitions. Issues such as ensuring a just and equitable transition for affected 
communities, managing retirement costs, and addressing potential loopholes that could delay the phase-out process are critical areas requiring further attention [3][6]. As Indonesia 
continues to navigate these challenges, its experience offers valuable lessons for other nations embarking on similar transitions.

Recent research highlights a significant reduction in coal power financing, with the world's largest banks decreasing their funding by a third from $44.5 billion in 2018 to $29.5 
billion in 2022 [6]. This trend underscores the growing financial industry's commitment to net zero and the potential impact of Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) in 
accelerating coal phase-out initiatives. The JETPs for Indonesia and Vietnam, aiming to mobilize $20 billion and $15.5 billion respectively, represent a systems-level approach to 
addressing the accelerated phase-out of coal-fired power alongside investment in enabling grid infrastructure and scaling up of renewables [6]. These partnerships, while not binding, 
offer a financially sizable step towards low-carbon transition efforts and provide a model for managing the social and technical aspects of coal phase-out transactions.
